    <p>Thanks for helping us on our research on human problem-solving!</p>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>You are going to be given 50 similar math problems with different amounts of time to solve each.  
    The entire test will take exactly 10 minutes from the time you click START.  You cannot finish a problem early.  
        Please don't do any other HITs at the same time and 
        please don't use a calculator -- we want to know how humans solve these problems themselves under time pressure.
    Each problem's timer is shown in the upper right corner.  
    You will be paid $1.00 for completing the hit, with a $0.10 bonus for each problem you solve 
    correctly, so your total payment will be between $1-$10 depending on accuracy.
